## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I am interested in using a de-identified marketing email dataset to understand:

1. How do user and email characteristics relate to email click-through rate (CTR)?
2. What combination of user and email characteristics does the data suggest to have the best chance of marketing email click-through?
3. If we were to provide any insights on email campaign personalization for the marketing team, what can we propose based on our analysis?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook that showcases the analysis and modeling related to the above questions is 'marketing_personalization.ipynb'. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium post [here](https://medium.com/@katdatsci/implementation-of-personalized-strategies-why-it-matters-d3b5a9b20a51).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The data files related to this project are owned by a marketing team who provides consultancy for e-commerce companies, so they are not publicly available, but the full analysis script has been made available in this repository. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
